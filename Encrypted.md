Challenge: Build a command-line tool that allows users to encode and decode messages using a simple substitution cipher, with the option to use multiple different encryption algorithms.

Sub-tasks:

1. Implement a basic command-line interface for the tool. (5 minutes)
1. Implement a substitution cipher algorithm that allows users to encode messages. (10 minutes)
1. Add functionality to allow users to decode messages using the same substitution cipher. (10 minutes)
1. Implement error handling and input validation to ensure that the tool functions properly and securely. (10 minutes)
1. Add additional features, such as the ability to save encoded messages to a file or copy them to the clipboard. (10 minutes)
1. Implement additional encryption algorithms, such as a Caesar cipher or a Vigen√®re cipher, and allow users to choose which algorithm to use. (optional - 20 minutes)
